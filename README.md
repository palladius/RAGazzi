# RAGazzi

RAGazzi is the non-plus-ultra distillation of RAG-as-a-Service (ragaas)

# Context

I was inspired by the idea of Nanobots https://github.com/icebaker/ruby-nano-bots and by my previous work on RAG and Wassser temperature ([article](https://medium.com/p/de69215d43df)) and I thought:

* How about creating a RAG-as-a-Service (RAGaaS) script and distill the `RAGs to Ricks` into YAML like the [Nanobots](https://github.com/icebaker/ruby-nano-bots), but focussed on RAG?
* While I'm there, how about finding a nice Italian name for it? how abut `RAGazzi`? Probably it would be better `RAGaaSsuoli` since we do RAG as a Service and grounding can be considered as `suolo` in italian. Plus my friends Fiore&Grufi like to say "ragassi" instead of ragazzi.

But again, if you're not Italian you're not probably getting these jokes, so enough with them.

# Implementation

I think it's cooler to lean on top of `ruby-nano-bots`, or of `langchainrb` to minimize the code.

# Running it

First install `html2text`.

```
 ./main.rb run latest-news-italy
```

## Samples

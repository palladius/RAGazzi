A question about the weather!

According to the website, you can find current and historical water temperature data for the canton of Zurich. The website also offers a map view that shows the current water temperatures at various monitoring stations in the canton.

To answer your question, I would recommend checking the "Aktuelle Karte" (Current Map) or "Aktuelle Tabelle" (Current Table) sections on the website to see the latest water temperature data. However, it appears that these sections are only available in German.

If you don't speak German, you can try using Google Translate to translate the website and access the information you're looking for. Alternatively, you can contact the Amt f√ºr Abfall, Wasser, Energie und Luft (Department of Waste, Water, Energy and Air) directly to ask about the current water temperature at ZurichSee.

Regarding tomorrow's forecast, I couldn't find any specific information on the website that would provide a detailed weather forecast for the next day. However, you may be able to find general weather forecasts for the canton of Zurich or even more localized forecasts by searching online or checking other weather websites.

I'm happy to help you with that!

Unfortunately, it seems that the website doesn't provide information on specific bathing sites like Utoquai or Mythenquai. However, I can suggest a possible approach:

You could try using the "Aktuelle Karte" (Current Map) feature on the website to get an overview of the current water temperatures at different stations in the canton Zurich. You might be able to find the station nearest to Utoquai or Mythenquai and then look up its current temperature.

Additionally, you could also try contacting the "Amt f√ºr Abfall, Wasser, Energie und Luft - Sektion Geoinformation und Hydrometrie" (Department for Waste, Water, Energy, and Air - Section of Geographic Information and Hydrology) directly via phone (+41 43 259 32 24) or email (hydrometrie@bd.zh.ch) to ask about the current water temperatures at those specific locations.

As soon as I have more information, I'll be happy to provide you with the answers!
